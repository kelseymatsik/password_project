# Visualizing Gmail Password Security 

I collaborated with University of Virginia Information Security to obtain a randomized list of over 760,000 gmail passwords. This interactive visualization uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within Observable to visualize the relationship between password length, composition, and crack difficulty. 

*Note*: The visualization only includes a randomized slice of 1,000 data points, as Observable can't handle more than that.  

Project completed Spring 2023 for Data Visualization class.
